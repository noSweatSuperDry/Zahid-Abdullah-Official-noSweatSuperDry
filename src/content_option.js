  aboutme:
    `My journey in the world of technology began with a Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology from Riveria, Joensuu, where I honed my skills and laid the foundation for an exciting career. 
    At Ecoaims oy, I thrive on a diverse range of technologies, including JavaScript, Node JS, React-native, and the dynamic Azure ecosystem including Azure portal, Azure DevOps, and Azure Cosmos DB. 
    However, my journey isn't confined solely to the realm of software development. In my earlier pursuits, I delved into the captivating world of Physics, holding two Master's degrees in Physics and Photonics. 
    My Photonics M.Sc. involved an intriguing thesis where I designed and analyzed a Micro-grid polarizer, showcasing my analytical prowess and innovative thinking.
     I've also spent significant time in Optical and clean-room laboratories, gaining invaluable hands-on experience. Beyond the confines of laboratories and code, 
     I've explored the intricacies of warehouse management, working with prominent entities like Posti and Customs Warehouse of Finland. With two years of hands-on experience,
      I've learned the nuances of inbound and outbound systems, highlighting my adaptability and commitment to mastering diverse domains. I invite you to explore my portfolio, 
      which showcases the culmination of my experiences, skills, and passion. From software development to physics and warehouse management, my journey is a testament to my relentless 
      pursuit of knowledge and excellence. Thank you for joining me on this captivating voyage.`,
